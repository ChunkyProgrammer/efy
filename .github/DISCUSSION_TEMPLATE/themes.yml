       Request adding a new theme to the public collection

       ## Checklist

       - Only submit your theme if you think others would need it. Quality over quantity
       - Check if the json is valid and works when you import it from `efy` > `backup`
       - Reduce the size or resolution of your images as much as possible (ideally between 50kb - 2mb) by compressing them and using formats like `webp` and `avif`
       - Remove unnecessary lines or content if other users won't need them
       - If you need help, let us know on matrix or here
