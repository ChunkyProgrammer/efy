# EFY UI
Customisable, convergent, transparent, modular, futuristic css / js framework that can be added to your own web / local apps & websites

## How to use it
Add the `efy_ui` folder in your project & the following html lines:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./efy/efy.css">
<script src="./efy/efy.js"></script>
```

Live demo & Documentation at: https://efy.ooo/ui

Local demo: just clone this repo & open the html file.

## Can I use it commercially?

Yes, but please donate if you want to support the project and can afford it, that would help a lot! Read the license for more details.

## How to help or contact me

Feedback is very important, so the more the better! Take screenshots or record videos too of your issues / ideas if needed. You can do that here or in the matrix room: https://matrix.to/#/#efy_ui:matrix.org where you can also talk to the community.

## Future Plans

- make the code 1/3 smaller (minus new features)
- improve accessibility
- collab with cool FOSS projects
- release a chromium extension that injects `efy ui` into any page
- standardise transparent ui
- Add support for tauri / electron (not a priority, but considered)
