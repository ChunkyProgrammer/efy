# EFY UI
Convergent, futuristic, modular, accessible, minimalist, customisable css / javascript framework

## How to use it
just include the `efy_ui` folder in your html project and add the following html lines:

```<link rel="stylesheet" href="./efy_ui/efy.min.css">```

```<script src="./efy_ui/efy.min.js"></script>```

Try a live demo at: https://efy.ooo/ui

## Documentation (coming soon)

In the next days hopefully

## Can I use it commercially?

For personal or FOSS projects it's free, for commercial projects you gotta pay $150 once per project. That's it, no monthly fees or limiting your features in exchange for money. You can also donate if you wanna support the project, which will make it cheaper for future users and developers.

You can read the license here: https://github.com/dragos-efy/efy_ui/blob/main/LICENSE.md

## How to help or contact me

Feedback is very important, so give as much of it as you want. Take screenshots or record videos too of your issues / ideas. You can do that here or in the matrix room: https://matrix.to/#/#efy_ui:matrix.org where you can also talk to the community or brag about your theme ðŸ™ƒ I'd love to see your configs, since `efy ui` allows us to let our personality shine through design more than it's ever been possible.

Donations are welcome as well.

## Future Plans

- make the code at least 1/3 smaller
- improve accessibility
- collab with cool FOSS projects
- release a chromium extension that injects `efy ui` into any page
- standardise transparent ui
- I'm too tired to write more, so we'll leave it as it is but there's clearly a ton more stuff coming lol
